# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

## Introduction
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, access to selected resources from a different origin. A web application executes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource that has a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) from its own.

## How CORS Works
Here’s how it works:
1. The browser sends an HTTP OPTIONS request, called a preflight request, to the server.
2. The server responds with an Access-Control-Allow-Origin (ACAO) header to indicate which origins are allowed.
3. If the server allows the origin, the browser sends the actual request with the actual HTTP request method (GET, POST, etc.).
4. The server must include the ACAO header in its response for the actual request.
This mechanism prevents many types of security issues, like CSRF attacks.

## CORS and Images
HTML provides a crossorigin attribute for images that, in combination with an appropriate CORS header, allows images defined by the <img> element that are loaded from foreign origins to be used in a <canvas> as if they had been loaded from the current origin. This is particularly useful when you want to manipulate images from other domains using canvas.

## Security and Tainted Canvases
Because the pixels in a canvas’s bitmap can come from a variety of sources, including images or videos retrieved from other hosts, it’s inevitable that security problems may arise. As soon as you draw into a canvas any data that was loaded from another origin without CORS approval, the canvas becomes tainted. A tainted canvas is one which is no longer considered secure, and any attempts to retrieve image data back from the canvas will cause an exception to be thrown.

## Conclusion
CORS is an essential part of modern web security and is implemented in all modern web browsers. Understanding how CORS works can help you build more secure web applications and avoid potential security pitfalls.
